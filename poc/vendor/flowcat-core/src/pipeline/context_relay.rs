//! ContextRelay — reusable context compaction for realtime (S2S) sessions.
//!
//! Real-time speech-to-speech models attend the **entire conversation on every
//! turn**, and audio tokens cost far more than text (≈25 tok/s of audio vs ≈3 tok/s
//! of the same speech as text). On a long call the audio context is re-attended —
//! and re-billed — every turn, so cost grows roughly with the square of the turn
//! count, and providers cap session length outright.
//!
//! [`ContextRelayProcessor`] keeps a compact **text digest** of the conversation
//! (a rolling summary of older turns + the most recent turns kept verbatim) and,
//! when a configurable budget is crossed, re-bases the live session onto that digest
//! by emitting a [`Reprompt`](super::s2s) — the same frame a graph transition uses,
//! which the realtime service turns into `update_system`. On a stateful provider
//! (e.g. a session that reopens on `update_system`) this drops the expensive audio
//! history and seeds the fresh session with the cheap text digest. The mechanism is
//! provider-agnostic: it rides only [`Frame::Transcription`], the `UsageReport` /
//! [`Reprompt`](super::s2s) custom frames, and the existing `update_system` seam,
//! all of which every realtime backend supports.
//!
//! ## Off by default
//!
//! The processor is inserted into the S2S chain only when a [`ContextRelayConfig`]
//! is supplied to the builder. With no config the pipeline is unchanged.
//!
//! ## When it fires
//!
//! Compaction is evaluated at the **end of a bot turn** — the `UsageReport` boundary
//! (`response.done`), which also carries the provider's per-turn `input_tokens`
//! (the live context size). That moment is the safe idle gap: the model has finished
//! responding and no user utterance is pending, so re-basing the session does not
//! discard an in-flight turn. (Firing at the *next user* turn instead would tear the
//! session down right as the user finished speaking, before the model could answer —
//! losing that turn.)
//!
//! Three triggers are evaluated at that boundary: the per-turn token **budget**
//! (`max_context_tokens`), the **session age** (`max_session_secs` — re-base ahead of
//! a provider's hard session cap, e.g. Gemini Live's ~15-min audio limit), and a
//! **turn-count** fallback. The session-age trigger bypasses the anti-thrash floor so
//! a hard cap is never missed. This composes with — and does not replace — a
//! provider's *native* session resumption for transient drops, which the realtime
//! client handles orthogonally to compaction.
//!
//! The digest also enriches **every** transition reprompt, so a graph transition that
//! re-establishes the session carries the conversation forward as text instead of
//! starting blank.
